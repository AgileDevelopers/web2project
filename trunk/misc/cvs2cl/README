A hacked version of cvs2cl used to update DP's Changelog file

How To by John Pritchard (20 Feb 2003)

SITUATION 
You have a WIN2K workstation with Cygwin, WINCVS, and SSH capabilities installed. You want to execute Kripper's web2Project script "cvs2cl.pl" to create a ChangeLog from the web2Project CVSROOT.

EXECUTION
1) Make sure you have a working copy of web2Project downloaded. Basically, you just need access to the cvs2cl.pl script. Navigate to the root of the web2project installation.

C:\{path}\web2project\>

2) Set path to the SourceForge web2Project repository:

C:\{path}\web2project\> set CVSROOT=:ext:{username}@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/web2project
C:\{path}\web2project\> set CVS_RSH=ssh

3) Run the "cvs2cl.pl" script
C:\{path}\web2project\> perl misc\cvs2cl\cvs2cl.pl --dp

(run "perl misc\cvs2cl\cvs2cl.pl --dp --accum" to only add new CL info to the existing, perhaps wrapped ChangeLog file)

OK this is all that is necessary to generate a new ChangeLog file that is nicely formatted with Kripper's web2project output. Very nice tool provided by Kripper.

4) Your web2project Root will now contain a new "ChangeLog" file. Simply check this into CVS to update the ChangeLog.
