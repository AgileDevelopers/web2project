/*
* This file exists in order to identify individual functions which will be
*   deprecated in coming releases.  In the documentation for each function,
*   you must describe two things:
*
*    * the specific version of web2project where the behavior will change; and
*    * a reference to the new/proper way of performing the same functionality.
*
* During Minor releases, this file will grow only to shrink as Major releases
*   allow us to delete functions.
*
* WARNING: This file does not identify class-level method deprecations.
*   In order to find those, you'll have to explore the individual classes.
